# class_notes

A collection of detailed concept maps I’ve created throughout my learning journey.

I used the app 'Concepts' to build these mindmaps. I love its infinite canvas. It lets me think without spatial constraints, and the app lets you export the drawings as SVGs, which are both lossless and easily compressible. 

I’m always exploring new ways to use my tools to make learning feel fun, intentional, and tailored to how I naturally process information. This whole system is deeply iterative - I’m constantly refining how I synthesize and visualize ideas.

I don’t make mind maps for every class. Only for the ones where a big-picture (literally!) representation helps me grasp the breadth of the material.
